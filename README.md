# My Astrology Page

I love astrology and use it in my day to day life so I thought, why not create a website of my own personal chart? Welcome to My Birth Chart Website! 
This project is a personal site where I display and analyze my astrological birth chart. 
The site provides an interactive view of my astrological placements and offers insights into how they might influence my personality and life. 
It helps me better understand myself as a person but also includes factual information as to why
the stars feel as through I would be an amazing employee for the next person based off of characteristics that are native to me.
